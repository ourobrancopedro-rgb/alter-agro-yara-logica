# YARA Lógica — Roadmap (Critical → High)

## Sprint 1 (Week 1–2) — Critical
- [x] Fix verify_hashes (missing/extra → fail-closed) + regression tests
- [x] Export control statement (legal/EXPORT_CONTROL.md)
- [x] Issue templates for INPI filing & defensive publication
- [ ] INPI filing (YARA Lógica) — status badge only
- [ ] Decision: Defensive Publication vs Patent (method DP; runtime as trade secret)

## Sprint 2 (Week 3–4) — High
- [ ] Unit tests (infra/github/*) + coverage badge
- [ ] Pre-commit validation in CI
- [ ] Benchmarks + docs/PERFORMANCE.md
- [ ] Diagrams (Mermaid) + examples sintéticos

> Public repo remains **spec-only**. No runtime, models, prompts or secrets.
